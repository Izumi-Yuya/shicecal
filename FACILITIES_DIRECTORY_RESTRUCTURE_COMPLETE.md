  - ✅ `facilities.land-info-edit` → `facilities.land-info.edit`

#### View Include Updates
- `resources/views/facilities/show.blade.php`
  - ✅ `facilities.partials.view-toggle` → `facilities.shared.view-toggle`
  - ✅ `facilities.partials.basic-info-table` → `facilities.basic-info.partials.table`
  - ✅ `facilities.partials.basic-info` → `facilities.basic-info.partials.display-card`

### 3. Cleanup Completed
- ✅ Removed empty directories (`partials/basic-info/`, `partials/land-info/`, `partials/`)

## 🔄 Remaining Tasks (Optional)

### Documentation Updates Needed
- Update `.kiro/specs/facility-land-information/design.md`
- Update `docs/components/service-table.md`
- Update staging files if they're actively used

### Test Updates Needed
- Some test files may need path updates if they fail
- Route names in tests should still work as they reference controller methods, not view paths

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each feature area has its own directory
2. **Better Maintainability**: Related files are grouped together
3. **Improved Reusability**: Shared components are clearly identified
4. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant files
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new feature areas without cluttering
6. **Consistent Structure**: Follows Laravel conventions and project patterns

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. Test facility listing page: `/facilities`
2. Test facility detail view: `/facilities/{id}`
3. Test basic info editing: `/facilities/{id}/basic-info/edit`
4. Test land info editing: `/facilities/{id}/land-info/edit`
5. Verify view toggle functionality works
6. Check service table rendering
7. Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions

## 📝 Notes

- All file moves preserve the original content
- Path updates maintain the same functionality
- The structure is now more maintainable and follows Laravel best practices
- Empty `components/` directory is ready for future reusable UI components
