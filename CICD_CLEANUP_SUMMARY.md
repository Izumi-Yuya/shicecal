# CI/CD Cleanup Summary

## Removed Files and Directories

### GitHub Actions and Workflows
- Removed entire `.github/` directory including:
  - `.github/workflows/` (all workflow files)
  - `.github/actions/` (all custom actions)

### Deployment Scripts and Configuration
- Removed entire `deployment/` directory including:
  - All AWS deployment scripts
  - Health check scripts
  - Rollback scripts
  - Nginx configuration files
  - All deployment documentation

### CI/CD Related Scripts
- `scripts/github-auth-helper.sh`
- `scripts/monitoring-setup.sh`
- `scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh`
- `scripts/backup-production.sh`
- `scripts/check-aws-deployment.sh`
- `scripts/production-health-check.sh`
- `scripts/test-setup.sh`
- `scripts/config.sh`

### Staging Environment
- Removed entire `staging/` directory (complete project copy)

### Documentation
- Removed `docs/deployment/` directory

### Makefile Cleanup
- Removed AWS deployment targets:
  - `deploy-aws`
  - `deploy-quick`
  - `deploy-full`

## Preserved Files

### Application Configuration
- Environment files (`.env*`) - AWS configurations kept for S3 file storage feature
- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` - For local development
- `Makefile` - Cleaned version for local development only

### Development Tools
- `docker/` directory - Development configuration files
- Development scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Local development documentation

## Next Steps

The project is now clean of CI/CD configurations. To set up new CI/CD:

1. Create new `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Add appropriate workflow files for your CI/CD needs
3. Configure deployment scripts as needed
4. Update documentation accordingly

## Notes

- AWS configurations in environment files are preserved as they're used for S3 file storage functionality
- Docker configurations are preserved for local development
- All legitimate application deployment references in documentation are preserved
