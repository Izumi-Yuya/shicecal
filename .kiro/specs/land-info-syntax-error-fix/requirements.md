# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The land information edit page has a Blade template syntax error causing the page to fail with "syntax error, unexpected token 'endif', expecting end of file". This is preventing users from accessing the land information editing functionality.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a user trying to edit land information, I want the page to load without syntax errors, so that I can access the land information editing form.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no "unexpected token 'endif'" errors
3. WHEN viewing the page THEN all Blade directives SHALL be properly structured and closed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want proper Blade template structure, so that the code is maintainable and error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the Blade template THEN all @if/@else/@endif directives SHALL be properly matched
2. WHEN the template is parsed THEN there SHALL be no duplicate closing tags
3. WHEN the conditional structure is evaluated THEN the template SHALL render correctly for both authorized and unauthorized users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with editing permissions, I want to access the land information form, so that I can edit facility land information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with editing permissions accesses the page THEN the land information form SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN a user without editing permissions accesses the page THEN the permission denied message SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the appropriate layout and scripts SHALL be included based on user permissions
