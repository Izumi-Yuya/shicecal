# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses display issues in the land information edit page by fixing HTML syntax errors, improving JavaScript functionality, and optimizing conditional section display logic. The design aims to provide users with appropriate section visibility based on ownership type and deliver a smooth operational experience.

## Architecture

### Current Issues

1. **HTML Syntax Errors**: Multiple div tags in Blade templates are not properly closed, causing rendering problems (addresses Requirement 1)
2. **JavaScript Initialization Issues**: ES6 modular approach may not be loading correctly, preventing proper functionality (addresses Requirement 3)
3. **Section Display Logic**: Conditional section show/hide functionality not working as expected when ownership type changes (addresses Requirement 2)
4. **Form Validation**: Hidden section fields are still being validated, causing irrelevant validation errors (addresses Requirement 4)
5. **Styling Consistency**: Improper application of Bootstrap 5.1.3 and responsive design issues affecting user experience (addresses Requirement 5)

### Solution Approach

1. **HTML Template Fixes**: Fix syntax errors in Blade templates and use proper Bootstrap 5.1.3 classes to achieve responsive design without console errors (addresses Requirement 1)
2. **JavaScript Integration**: Integrate existing modular code and leverage ES6 module system to improve error resilience and ensure reliable initialization (addresses Requirement 3)
3. **Section Management**: Improve dynamic display logic based on ownership type (owned/leased) with smooth animated transitions and proper styling (addresses Requirement 2)
4. **Validation System**: Implement dynamic validation rules that only validate visible sections and clear errors when sections are hidden (addresses Requirement 4)
5. **Calculation Features**: Ensure reliable operation of automatic calculation functions for price per tsubo and contract period with proper user feedback (addresses Requirement 3)
6. **User Experience**: Maintain consistent Bootstrap styling and responsive design across all screen sizes (addresses Requirement 5)

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Blade Template (`resources/views/facilities/land-info/edit.blade.php`)

#### Areas Requiring Fixes
- Missing closing div tags for conditional sections (addresses Requirement 1)
- Proper application of Bootstrap 5.1.3 classes (addresses Requirement 5)
- Addition of accessibility attributes (addresses Requirement 5)
- Ensuring responsive design (addresses Requirement 5)

#### Improvements
```blade
<!-- Before -->
<div id="owned_section" class="conditional-section d-none"
    <x-form.section>
    <!-- Content -->
    </x-form.section>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<div id="owned_section" class="conditional-section d-none" aria-hidden="true">
    <x-form.section>
    <!-- Content -->
    </x-form.section>
</div>
```

#### Section Display Control Design Decisions
- Use `d-none` class to leverage Bootstrap standard display control for consistent behavior
- Improve accessibility with `aria-hidden` attribute to support screen readers
- Add CSS transitions for smooth, non-jarring transition effects (addresses Requirement 2.3, 2.4)
- Ensure proper styling and layout when sections are displayed (addresses Requirement 2.4)

### 2. JavaScript Integration (`resources/js/land-info.js`)

#### Current Structure
- `LandInfoManager` class: Main functionality
- Modular approach: `resources/js/modules/land-info/`
- New integration file: `resources/js/land-info-new.js`

#### Integration Strategy
1. Use existing `land-info.js` as foundation and ensure ES6 modules initialize without errors (addresses Requirement 3.1)
2. Gradually integrate modular components leveraging ES6 module system for better maintainability
3. Add fallback functionality and error handling to improve error resilience (addresses Requirement 3.1)
4. Ensure reliable initialization and operation of calculation features (price per tsubo, contract period) with automatic updates (addresses Requirement 3.2, 3.3)
5. Implement proper validation execution with clear user feedback (addresses Requirement 3.4, 3.5)

#### JavaScript Initialization Design Decisions
- Leverage ES6 module system to improve code maintainability
- Strengthen error resilience with try-catch exception handling
- Guarantee reliable initialization with DOMContentLoaded event

### 3. Section Management System

#### Section Visibility Rules (addresses Requirement 2.1, 2.2)
```javascript
const SECTION_VISIBILITY_RULES = {
  owned_section: ['owned'],           // Show only when "owned" is selected
  leased_section: ['leased'],         // Show only when "leased" is selected
  management_section: ['leased'],     // Show only when "leased" is selected
  owner_section: ['leased'],          // Show only when "leased" is selected
  file_section: ['leased']            // Show only when "leased" is selected
};
```

#### Display Control Flow
1. Detection of ownership type selection (owned/leased) (addresses Requirement 2.1, 2.2)
2. Calculation of section visibility based on display rules
3. Smooth animated show/hide transitions with proper styling (addresses Requirement 2.3, 2.4, 5.2)
4. Field clearing and validation error reset for hidden sections (addresses Requirement 4.3)
5. Dynamic updating of aria-hidden attributes to ensure accessibility
6. Ensure only relevant sections are displayed based on ownership type (addresses Requirement 2.1, 2.2)

#### Section Management Design Decisions
- Predictable behavior through clear display rules
- Smooth transitions leveraging Bootstrap 5.1.3 transition functionality
- Data integrity through clearing of hidden section data

## Data Models

### Form Data Structure
```javascript
{
  // Basic information
  ownership_type: 'owned|leased',
  parking_spaces: number,
  
  // Area information
  site_area_sqm: number,
  site_area_tsubo: number,
  
  // Owned property information (when owned)
  purchase_price: number,
  
  // Leased property information (when leased)
  monthly_rent: number,
  contract_start_date: date,
  contract_end_date: date,
  auto_renewal: 'yes|no',
  
  // Management company information (when leased)
  management_company_*: string,
  
  // Owner information (when leased)
  owner_*: string,
  
  // Notes
  notes: string
}
```

### Validation Rules (addresses Requirement 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4)
```javascript
const VALIDATION_RULES = {
  owned: {
    required: ['ownership_type'],
    optional: ['purchase_price', 'site_area_sqm', 'site_area_tsubo', 'parking_spaces'],
    validate_only: 'owned_section'  // Only validate owned property fields
  },
  leased: {
    required: ['ownership_type'],
    optional: ['monthly_rent', 'contract_start_date', 'contract_end_date', 'auto_renewal', 'parking_spaces'],
    validate_only: ['leased_section', 'management_section', 'owner_section']  // Only validate leased-related fields
  }
};
```

### Calculation Functions (addresses Requirement 3)
```javascript
const CALCULATION_FUNCTIONS = {
  // Price per tsubo calculation: Purchase price รท Site area (tsubo)
  pricePerTsubo: (purchasePrice, siteAreaTsubo) => {
    return siteAreaTsubo > 0 ? Math.round(purchasePrice / siteAreaTsubo) : 0;
  },
  
  // Contract period calculation: End date - Start date
  contractPeriod: (startDate, endDate) => {
    if (!startDate || !endDate) return '';
    const start = new Date(startDate);
    const end = new Date(endDate);
    const diffTime = Math.abs(end - start);
    const diffDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    return `${diffDays} days`;
  }
};
```
