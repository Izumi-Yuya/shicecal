# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The land information edit page has display issues preventing proper functionality. Users cannot properly view and interact with conditional sections based on ownership type selection, and HTML syntax errors are causing rendering problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user editing land information, I want the page to display correctly without HTML syntax errors, so that I can properly view all form sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the land information edit page loads THEN all HTML elements SHALL render correctly without syntax errors
2. WHEN viewing the page source THEN all HTML tags SHALL be properly closed and formatted
3. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to HTML parsing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user selecting ownership type, I want related sections to be dynamically shown and hidden, so that I only see fields relevant to my selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "owned" ownership type is selected THEN the owned property section SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN "leased" ownership type is selected THEN the leased property, management company, and owner information sections SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN ownership type is changed THEN previously displayed sections SHALL smoothly hide
4. WHEN sections are displayed THEN they SHALL appear with proper styling and layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user operating the land information form, I want JavaScript functionality to work correctly, so that calculations and validations function as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN JavaScript modules SHALL initialize without errors
2. WHEN purchase price and site area are entered THEN price per tsubo SHALL be automatically calculated
3. WHEN contract dates are entered THEN contract period SHALL be automatically calculated
4. WHEN the form is submitted THEN validation SHALL execute and appropriate feedback SHALL be displayed
5. WHEN validation errors exist THEN they SHALL be clearly displayed to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with different ownership types, I want only relevant fields to be required and validated, so that I don't get errors for fields that don't apply to my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ownership type is "owned" THEN only owned property fields SHALL be validated
2. WHEN ownership type is "leased" THEN leased property, management company, and owner information fields SHALL be validated
3. WHEN ownership type is changed THEN validation errors for hidden sections SHALL be cleared
4. WHEN the form is submitted THEN only validation for visible fields SHALL be executed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the land information edit page, I want consistent styling and user experience, so that I have a polished and professional interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sections are displayed THEN consistent Bootstrap styling SHALL be used
2. WHEN sections show or hide THEN smooth and non-jarring transitions SHALL be executed
3. WHEN the page loads THEN all form elements SHALL be properly positioned and spaced
4. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL be responsive
5. WHEN interacting with form elements THEN visual feedback SHALL be consistent with the rest of the application
