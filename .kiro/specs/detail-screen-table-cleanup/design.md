# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the systematic removal of discontinued table format components from the Shise-Cal facility management system. The table infrastructure was originally designed to provide standardized table views for facility details but has been replaced by card-based layouts. This cleanup will remove all table-related services, components, configurations, and tests while preserving the existing card-based detail views.

## Architecture

### Current Table Infrastructure

The system currently contains the following table-related components that need removal:

**Service Layer:**
- `TableViewHelper` - Utility service for table data preparation and CSS generation
- `TableDataFormatter` - Service for formatting data based on column configurations
- `TableConfigService` - Service for managing table configurations and validation
- `TablePerformanceService` - Service for table performance optimization
- `TableErrorHandler` - Service for handling table-related errors
- `TableConfigValidator` - Service for validating table configurations

**View Components:**
- `universal-table.blade.php` - Main universal table component
- `universal-table/` directory with sub-components:
  - `standard-table.blade.php`
  - `key-value-pairs.blade.php`
  - `grouped-rows.blade.php`
  - `service-table.blade.php`
  - `nested-table.blade.php`
- `table-comment-section.blade.php` - Table comment integration
- `table-comment-wrapper.blade.php` - Table comment wrapper

**Configuration:**
- `config/table-config.php` - Table configuration definitions

**Frontend Assets:**
- `resources/css/components/service-table.css`
- `resources/css/components/advanced-tables.css`
- `resources/css/components/memory-optimized-tables.css`
- `resources/js/modules/table-performance.js`
- `resources/js/modules/table-view-comments.js`
- `resources/js/shared/memory-manager.js`

### Preserved Components

The following components will be preserved as they support the current card-based layout:

**Card-Based Views:**
- `resources/views/facilities/basic-info/show.blade.php` - Card-based facility details
- Card-specific CSS in `resources/css/pages/facilities.css`
- Form layout components in `resources/js/modules/facility-form-layout.js`

## Components and Interfaces

### Removal Strategy

#### Phase 1: Service Layer Cleanup
1. **Remove Table Services:**
   - Delete `app/Services/TableViewHelper.php`
   - Delete `app/Services/TableDataFormatter.php`
   - Delete `app/Services/TableConfigService.php`
   - Delete `app/Services/TablePerformanceService.php`
   - Delete `app/Services/TableErrorHandler.php`
   - Delete `app/Services/TableConfigValidator.php`
   - Delete `app/Services/ValidationResult.php` (if only used by table services)

2. **Update Service Dependencies:**
   - Remove table service registrations from service providers
   - Remove table service imports from controllers
   - Update any remaining services that reference table services

#### Phase 2: View Component Cleanup
1. **Remove Universal Table Components:**
   - Delete `resources/views/components/universal-table.blade.php`
   - Delete entire `resources/views/components/universal-table/` directory
   - Delete `resources/views/components/table-comment-section.blade.php`
   - Delete `resources/views/components/table-comment-wrapper.blade.php`

2. **Update View References:**
   - Remove `@include` and `<x-universal-table>` references from existing views
   - Update `resources/views/facilities/services/partials/standardized-table.blade.php` to use card layout or remove entirely
   - Clean up any remaining table component references

#### Phase 3: Configuration Cleanup
1. **Remove Table Configuration:**
   - Delete `config/table-config.php`
   - Remove table configuration references from other config files
   - Update any configuration loading that references table configs

#### Phase 4: Frontend Asset Cleanup
1. **Remove CSS Files:**
   - Delete `resources/css/components/service-table.css`
   - Delete `resources/css/components/advanced-tables.css`
   - Delete `resources/css/components/memory-optimized-tables.css`
   - Remove table-related CSS imports from main stylesheets

2. **Remove JavaScript Files:**
   - Delete `resources/js/modules/table-performance.js`
   - Delete `resources/js/modules/table-view-comments.js`
   - Delete `resources/js/shared/memory-manager.js`
   - Remove table-related JS imports from main application files

#### Phase 5: Test Cleanup
1. **Remove Test Files:**
   - Delete all files in `tests/Feature/` related to table functionality
   - Delete all files in `tests/Unit/Services/` related to table services
   - Delete all files in `tests/Browser/` related to table behavior
   - Delete JavaScript test files related to table functionality

## Data Models

### Impact Assessment

The table removal will not affect core data models as the table infrastructure was purely presentational. The following models remain unchanged:

- `Facility` model - Core facility data
- `LandInfo` model - Land information data
- `FacilityService` model - Service information data
- `Comment` model - Comment functionality (will work with card views)

### Configuration Migration

Since table configurations are being removed, any dynamic configuration needs will be handled through:

1. **Static Configuration:** Hard-coded display logic in card components
2. **Model Attributes:** Display formatting handled by model accessors
3. **View Helpers:** Simple helper functions for formatting (not full table services)

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

During the removal process, ensure graceful handling of:

1. **Missing Service References:**
   - Catch and log any remaining references to removed table services
   - Provide fallback behavior where necessary
   - Update dependency injection to remove table service bindings

2. **View Rendering Errors:**
   - Ensure no broken `@include` or component references remain
   - Test all facility detail views to confirm card layout functionality
   - Verify responsive behavior on all screen sizes

3. **Configuration Errors:**
   - Remove all references to `table-config.php`
   - Update any configuration caching that might reference table configs
   - Clear application caches after removal

### Error Recovery

If issues arise during removal:

1. **Service Layer Issues:**
   - Temporarily stub removed services if needed for gradual migration
   - Use feature flags to control table vs card rendering during transition

2. **View Issues:**
   - Maintain backup copies of critical view files
   - Test thoroughly in development environment before production deployment

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Removal Testing

1. **Functionality Verification:**
   - Document current card-based view behavior
   - Create baseline screenshots of all facility detail screens
   - Verify all user interactions work correctly with card layout

2. **Performance Baseline:**
   - Measure page load times for facility detail views
   - Document memory usage patterns
   - Establish baseline for responsive behavior

### Post-Removal Testing

1. **Functionality Testing:**
   - Verify all facility detail views render correctly
   - Test responsive behavior on various screen sizes
   - Confirm all user interactions continue to work
   - Validate accessibility compliance

2. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure page load improvements after removing unused code
   - Verify memory usage reduction
   - Test application startup time improvements

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test facility creation, editing, and viewing workflows
   - Verify comment functionality works with card views
   - Test export functionality (if it doesn't depend on table components)

### Regression Testing

1. **Core Functionality:**
   - Facility management operations
   - User authentication and authorization
   - File upload and management
   - Comment system functionality

2. **UI/UX Testing:**
   - Visual consistency across all facility views
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Browser compatibility
