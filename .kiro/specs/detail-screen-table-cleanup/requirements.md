# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The detail screen table format has been discontinued in the Shise-Cal facility management system. This cleanup task involves removing all related files, logic, methods, and components that were specifically designed for table-based detail views. The system should maintain its current card-based detail view format while eliminating unused table infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want to remove discontinued table format components, so that the codebase remains clean and maintainable without unused code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN all universal table components SHALL be removed from the system
2. WHEN checking service classes THEN TableViewHelper, TableDataFormatter, TableConfigService, and TablePerformanceService SHALL be deleted
3. WHEN examining configuration files THEN table-config.php SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing view components THEN all universal-table blade components SHALL be deleted
5. WHEN checking CSS files THEN table-specific stylesheets SHALL be removed
6. WHEN examining JavaScript modules THEN table-related JS files SHALL be deleted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all references to table components removed from existing views, so that there are no broken references or unused imports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining blade templates THEN all references to universal-table components SHALL be removed
2. WHEN checking service partials THEN standardized-table.blade.php SHALL be deleted or refactored
3. WHEN reviewing view imports THEN all table-related CSS and JS imports SHALL be removed
4. WHEN checking controllers THEN all table-related method calls SHALL be removed
5. WHEN examining configuration usage THEN all references to table-config SHALL be eliminated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all table-related tests removed, so that the test suite only covers active functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all table-related test files SHALL be deleted
2. WHEN checking test coverage THEN no table component tests SHALL remain
3. WHEN examining feature tests THEN table standardization tests SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing unit tests THEN table service tests SHALL be deleted
5. WHEN checking browser tests THEN responsive table behavior tests SHALL be removed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the current card-based detail views preserved, so that facility information display continues to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing facility basic info THEN the card-based layout SHALL remain functional
2. WHEN accessing facility details THEN all information SHALL display correctly without table components
3. WHEN checking responsive behavior THEN card layouts SHALL work on all screen sizes
4. WHEN testing user interactions THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN reviewing accessibility THEN card-based views SHALL maintain accessibility compliance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation updated to reflect the removal of table components, so that future development doesn't reference discontinued features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing component documentation THEN table-related docs SHALL be removed or updated
2. WHEN checking configuration documentation THEN table-config references SHALL be eliminated
3. WHEN examining development guides THEN table component examples SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing architecture docs THEN table system references SHALL be updated
5. WHEN checking API documentation THEN table-related endpoints SHALL be reviewed and updated if necessary
